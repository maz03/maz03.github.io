  <h style="color: white;font-size:50px;"><b>Organisational Structure</b></h>
  <br>
  <p style="color: white;"> We used the water fall methodology, because it was appealing in the ways that I looked easy to use,  and it was a good way to structure our website. By following this methodology template this was the basis structure for our whole making of the website. We looked at the requirements and made sure that we knew what was required of us. Then we talked about design and what we wanted to be in this website, which lead to the creation of the wire frame. The next step was implementation using the water fall methodology. Which Matthew is implementing the logo and the website icon and to gather and upload images onto the website. So using this methodology, it gave us clear insight on where we should be focused working on which was very helpful because everything flowed nicely as it should of. The next step was verification which we were not to sure on. What we put it down to was documenting out progress and confirming weather we met the set requirements and basically tick of issues and sprint tasks on git hub. The next step was deployment which was having everything all finished up and deploying out assignment to EIT online and having the website public online.â€‹

  <h style="color: white;font-size:50px;"><b>Our Organisation</b></h>
  <br>
  <p style="color: white;"> Our company Holographics is a Limited Liability Company which was created on 19th May 2021. What we were aiming for is to have a fully functioning Movies/ tv series / Anime / short films-based website.

  This is going to implement easy to navigate and use web-based features such as good navigation bar, good and easily readable search bar, good features which makes it easy to return to home and or films, videos you have watched or currently watching, this is useful because it provides the user with the best experience and helps to gain popularity over the other film websites, hopefully for using the website being able to integrate it into an app to also help with accessibility and useability. This will be accommodated with recommendations and reviews on the films and short films to help guide the user to a film that may appeal to the user.  </p>

  <h style="color: white;font-size:50px;"><b>Our Competition</b></h>
  <br>
  <p style="color: white;"> First steps were to think of what we want more from or what we thought was lacking in websites today, and a commonly used website we both use is Netflix's, but I also pointed out that I use various other websites to watch other films and anime which Netflix's lacked in. Variety and some of their main features were clunky and hard to use such as trying to find specific films and other movies, but rather than saying no available or showing the movie you searched other suggestions came up which made it hard to find what you wanted. So, to fix this we wanted to take the best out of all other film websites/apps. So that was the idea which led to the concept plan of our decided website. This website will have a target audience of all ages, so have safety options for children with parental locks and have categories recommended to specific generation groups and gender groups. </p>
