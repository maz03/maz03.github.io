  <h style="color: white;font-size:50px;"><b>Groups Biography</b></h>
  <br>
  <p style="color: white;"> Matthew Simpson - From Wairoa, Live in Greenmeadows, taking Bachelor of Computing Systems. Worked as a barista for two years.</p>
  <p style="color: white;"> Caleb Lampitt - From Christchurch, live in Taradale, Doing a Diploma in Computing Systems. Work in Liquor AT Pak'n'save Tamatea.</p> 
  
  <h style="color: white;font-size:50px;"><b>Organisational Structure</b></h>
  <br>
  <p style="color: white;"> We have utilized the waterfall agile methodology to track our progress and manage tasks. This involves 5 aspects; Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification and Deployment. In short, it allows us to look at the end goal directly.</p>
  
  <h style="color: white;font-size:50px;"><b>Our Organisation</b></h>
  <br>
  <p style="color: white;"> Our company Holographics is a Limited Liability Company which was created on 19th May 2021. What we were aiming for is to have a fully functioning Movies/ tv series / Anime / short films-based website.

  This is going to implement easy to navigate and use web-based features such as good navigation bar, good and easily readable search bar, good features which makes it easy to return to home and or films, videos you have watched or currently watching, this is useful because it provides the user with the best experience and helps to gain popularity over the other film websites, hopefully for using the website being able to integrate it into an app to also help with accessibility and useability. This will be accommodated with recommendations and reviews on the films and short films to help guide the user to a film that may appeal to the user.  </p>

  <h style="color: white;font-size:50px;"><b>Our Competition</b></h>
  <br>
  <p style="color: white;"> First steps were to think of what we want more from or what we thought was lacking in websites today, and a commonly used website we both use is Netflix's, but I also pointed out that I use various other websites to watch other films and anime which Netflix's lacked in. Variety and some of their main features were clunky and hard to use such as trying to find specific films and other movies, but rather than saying no available or showing the movie you searched other suggestions came up which made it hard to find what you wanted. So, to fix this we wanted to take the best out of all other film websites/apps. So that was the idea which led to the concept plan of our decided website. This website will have a target audience of all ages, so have safety options for children with parental locks and have categories recommended to specific generation groups and gender groups. </p>
